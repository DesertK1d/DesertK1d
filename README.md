- 👋 Hi, I’m @DesertK1d
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to read code, use code, create and be able to learn more about all of this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the different electronic components that make technology work as well as trying to learn the basics of the different types of coding and how to use them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that anyone could use help on that doesn't mind answering questions and possibly teaching me a thing or two, or just anyone who needs an extra set of eyes and hands to do whatever.
- 📫 How to reach me if not on here than I'm not sure.
